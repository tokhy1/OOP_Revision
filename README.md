# üöÄ OOP Revision Repository

Welcome to the **OOP Revision Repository**! This repository is dedicated to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and features across various programming languages. It serves as a valuable resource for learners and developers to explore OOP principles through practical examples in different languages.

## üìò Definition of OOP
**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to represent data and methods. It enables the creation of modular, reusable, and organized code, promoting the use of classes and objects to model real-world entities.

## üìú History and Evolution
OOP originated in the 1960s with languages like **Simula**, which introduced the concept of classes and objects. The paradigm gained popularity in the 1980s with the introduction of languages such as **C++** and **Smalltalk**. Over time, OOP has evolved and influenced many modern programming languages, including **Java**, **Python**, and **C#**.

## üí° Benefits of OOP
- **Modularity**: Code is organized into discrete objects, making it easier to manage and maintain.
- **Reusability**: Classes can be reused across different programs, reducing redundancy.
- **Encapsulation**: Data is hidden within objects, providing a clear interface and enhancing security.
- **Inheritance**: New classes can inherit properties and methods from existing classes, promoting code reuse and flexibility.
- **Polymorphism**: Objects can be treated as instances of their parent class, allowing for dynamic method resolution and enhancing code flexibility.
